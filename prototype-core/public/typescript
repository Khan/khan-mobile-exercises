There are 2325 exercises in exercises.json


This... may take awhile. Just leave this thing running as long as you like.
Progress is saved every 20 items, so no worries if you bail out early.
If you bail out early, you won't have ALL exercises loaded - but you're probably Just Fine Without All Of The Exercises.




OK, a REALLY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:
This will overwrite exercise-summaries.json - so be really sure you want to do this! I'll wait...
I'm assuming your silence means 'ok, computer, go do your thing'?
ok ok - here we go!

This... may take awhile. Just leave this thing running as long as you like.
Progress is saved every 20 items, so no worries if you bail out early.
If you bail out early, you won't have ALL exercises loaded - but you're probably Just Fine Without All Of The Exercises.




OK, a REALLY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:
This will overwrite exercise-summaries.json - so be really sure you want to do this! I'll wait...
I'm assuming your silence means 'ok, computer, go do your thing'?
ok ok - here we go!
