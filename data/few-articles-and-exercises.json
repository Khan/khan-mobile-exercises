        "content": "#What is tubular reabsorption?\n\nThe fluid that filters through the glomerulus and Bowman\u2019s capsule (glomerular filtrate) is very similar to blood plasma without the proteins, and at this point not at all like urine. If this filtrate flowed straight to your bladder and then out your body, you would lose more than 10-times the entire volume of your extracellular body fluids (plasma and interstitial fluid) every day. Fortunately, tubular reabsorption mechanisms in the nephrons of your kidneys return the water and solutes that you need back into your extracellular fluid and circulatory system. In addition to reabsorbing the substances that you need, your nephrons are able to secrete unwanted substances from your bloodstream into the filtrate. Together these processes complete the transformation of the glomerular filtrate into urine.    \n\n- Tubular reabsorption is the process that moves solutes and water out of the filtrate and back into your bloodstream. This process is known as reabsorption, because this is the second time they have been absorbed; the first time being when they were absorbed into the bloodstream from the digestive tract after a meal.\n\n#How does reabsorption in the nephrons work?\n\nThe nephrons in your kidneys are specifically designed to maintain body fluid homeostasis. This means keeping extracellular body fluid volumes stable, as well as maintaining the right levels of the salts and minerals that are essential for the normal function of your tissues and organs; regardless of how much you eat, or how active you are. Nephrons are divided into five segments, with different segments responsible for reabsorbing different substances.\t\n\n[[\u2603 image 1]]\n\nReabsorption is a two-step process:\n\n-  The first step is the passive or active movement of water and dissolved substances from the fluid inside the tubule through the tubule wall into the space outside.\n\n- The second step is for water and these substances to move through the capillary walls back into your bloodstream, again, either by passive or active transport.\n\nNephrons are comprised of different segments that perform specific functions. The walls of the nephron are made of a single layer of cube-like cells, called cuboidal epithelial cells, and their ultrastructure changes depending on the function of the segment they are in. For example, the surface of the cells facing the lumen of the proximal convoluted tubule are covered in microvilli (tiny finger-like structures). This type of surface is called a brush border. The brush border and the extensive length of the proximal tubule dramatically increase the surface area available for reabsorption of substances into the blood enabling around 80% of the glomerular filtrate to be reabsorbed in this segment. Another notable feature of these cells is that they are densely packed with mitochondria (the cell\u2019s energy generators). The mitochondria ensure a good supply of energy is available to fuel the active transport systems needed for efficient reabsorption. \n\n[[\u2603 image 2]]\n\n*Passive transport* is when substances use specific transporters to move down their concentration gradient (from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration) or in the case of charged ions, down their electrochemical gradient. \n\n*Active transport*  is when substances are moved up (or against) their concentration or electrochemical gradients (from low to high). In this case, the substances are transported back into the bloodstream via energy-dependent, or active transport proteins. \n\n# Reabsorption of sodium, nutrients, water, and other ions\n\nSodium is the major positively charged electrolyte in extracellular body fluid. The amount of sodium in the fluid influences its volume, which in turn determines blood volume and blood pressure. Most of the solute reabsorbed in the proximal tubule is in the form of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride, and about 70% of the sodium reabsorption occurs here. Sodium reabsorption is tightly coupled to passive water reabsorption, meaning when sodium moves, water follows. The movement of water balances the osmotic pressure within or across the tubule walls, which maintains extracellular body fluid volume. \n\n*Reabsorption in the early proximal convoluted tubule*: The most essential substances in the filtrate are reabsorbed in the first half of the proximal convoluted tubule (early proximal tubule). These include glucose, amino acids, phosphate, lactate and citrate, which \u201cpiggy-back\u201d on sodium co-transporters (membrane proteins that link the movement of two or more specific solutes together) that move sodium down its electrochemical gradient into tubule epithelial cells. For this to continue, the sodium gradient must be maintained, which means sodium cannot be allowed to build up inside the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule wall. This is achieved using:\n\n- *Sodium/potassium* ATPase, a sodium pump (active transporter) located on the opposite side of the epithelial cell that takes care of this by moving three sodium ions out of the cell for reabsorption into the bloodstream, and pumping two potassium ions back into the cell (see diagram below). \n- *Sodium/proton exchanger*, which enables reabsorption of bicarbonate. Glucose, amino acids and other substances diffuse out of the epithelial cell down their concentration gradients on passive transporters and are then reabsorbed by the blood capillaries. By the time the filtrate has reached the mid part of the proximal tubule, 100% of the filtered glucose and amino acids have been reabsorbed, and large amounts of sodium, bicarbonate, phosphate, lactate, and citrate ions. \n\n[[\u2603 image 3]]\n\n\n*Reabsorption in the late proximal convoluted tubule*: The fluid entering the late proximal tubule has been depleted of the essential substances. As bicarbonate was the negatively charged ion initially reabsorbed with sodium, chloride ions have been left behind in the tubule. Due to the extensive reabsorption of water in the early section of the tubule, chloride ions are highly concentrated, and it is now their turn for reabsorption. They are transported into the tubule epithelial cells through the following processes:\n\n- *Chloride/formate anion exchangers* driven by the high concentration of chloride in the filtrate. Chloride diffuses out of the cell through channels in the cell wall, and then on into the bloodstream. \n\n- *Passive movement* through the spaces between epithelial cells of the tubule wall, known as tight junctions, which contrary to their name are not so tight. This is another important route for reabsorption of small solutes such as sodium chloride, and of water. Sodium continues to be reabsorbed in this part of the tubule via sodium/proton exchangers and actively transported through the tubule wall to the bloodstream by the sodium/potassium ATPase. After leaving the proximal convoluted tubule, the tubular fluid enters the proximal straight tubule, where around 15% of the phosphate is reabsorbed.\n\n[[\u2603 image 4]]\n\n*Reabsorption in the loop of Henle*: The filtrate then enters the loop of Henle (descending and ascending limbs), which is responsible for concentrating or diluting the tubular fluid using a process called countercurrent multiplication. The distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts are then largely responsible for reabsorbing water as required to produce urine at a concentration that maintains body fluid homeostasis. \n\n*Reabsorption in the thick ascending limb:* A further 25% of the sodium and potassium is reabsorbed through the walls of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle via:\n\n- *Three-ion cotransporter* (sodium/potassium/chloride) and the sodium/potassium ATPase, which as before maintains the sodium concentration gradient. Sodium is actively pumped out, while potassium and chloride diffuse down their electrochemical gradients through channels in the tubule wall and into the bloodstream. The walls of the thick ascending limb are impermeable to water, so in this section of the nephron water is not reabsorbed along with sodium.  \n\n[[\u2603 image 5]]\n\n*Reabsorption in the distal tubule and collecting duct*: The tubular fluid now enters the distal tubule and collecting duct, or terminal nephron. The early distal tubule reabsorbs a further 5% of the sodium, and the late distal tubule and collecting duct fine tune reabsorption of the last little bit (around 3%), determining exactly how much sodium will be excreted. These segments of the nephron have slightly different transporters, as well as the sodium/potassium ATPase that drives reabsorption of calcium and chloride. Sodium reabsorption in the late distal tubule and collecting duct is regulated by hormones, which stimulate or inhibit sodium reabsorption as necessary. \n\n*Other ions*: Calcium reabsorption throughout the nephron is largely similar to sodium reabsorption with over 99% being reabsorbed, while phosphate reabsorption is similar to that of glucose in that it primarily occurs within the proximal tubule. Reabsorption of magnesium differs in that the majority of the reabsorption occurs in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. \n\n# Consider the following:\n\n- Urine contains a diverse range of substances that are either waste products or substances ingested in excess. The importance of the kidneys in maintaining body fluid composition is clear when we look at what happens when we consider the impact on the body when our kidneys start to fail. Retention of waste products causes disturbances in multiple organ systems including cardiovascular, hematological, gastrointestinal, neurological, skeletal, hormonal, respiratory, skin and reproductive systems. Loss of water and electrolyte homeostasis lead to elevated extracellular body fluid volume, which may produce edema and hypertension, reduced phosphate excretion, loss of bone calcium, and symptoms of lethargy, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. \n\n- Diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder that causes you to feel very thirsty (despite drinking a lot), and to produce large amounts of urine. It is usually caused by a malfunction in the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a hormone that prevents the production of dilute urine (i.e., retains water in the body). This can happen for a number of different reasons, including damage to the pituitary; e.g., caused by a tumour, surgery, or an infection, that disrupts the normal production, storage and release of ADH. However, it may also occur due to a defect in the tubules themselves that prevents them from responding to ADH, or during pregnancy, when a placental enzyme destroys ADH in the mother. \n\n\n",

The movement of water balances the osmotic pressure within or across the tubule walls, which maintains extracellular body fluid volume. \\n\\n*Reabsorption in the early proximal convoluted tubule*: The most essential substances in the filtrate are reabsorbed in the first half of the proximal convoluted tubule (early proximal tubule). These include glucose, amino acids, phosphate, lactate and citrate, which \u201cpiggy-back\u201d on sodium co-transporters (membrane proteins that link the movement of two or more specific solutes together) that move sodium down its electrochemical gradient into tubule epithelial cells. For this to continue, the sodium gradient must be maintained, which means sodium cannot be allowed to build up inside the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule wall. This is achieved using:\\n\\n- *Sodium/potassium* ATPase, a sodium pump (active transporter) located on the opposite side of the epithelial cell that takes care of this by moving three sodium ions out of the cell for reabsorption into the bloodstream, and pumping two potassium ions back into the cell (see diagram below). \\n- *Sodium/proton exchanger*, which enables reabsorption of bicarbonate. Glucose, amino acids and other substances diffuse out of the epithelial cell down their concentration gradients on passive transporters and are then reabsorbed by the blood capillaries. By the time the filtrate has reached the mid part of the proximal tubule, 100% of the filtered glucose and amino acids have been reabsorbed, and large amounts of sodium, bicarbonate, phosphate, lactate, and citrate ions. \\n\\n[[\u2603 image 3]]\\n\\n\\n*Reabsorption in the late proximal convoluted tubule*: The fluid entering the late proximal tubule has been depleted of the essential substances. As bicarbonate was the negatively charged ion initially reabsorbed with sodium, chloride ions have been left behind in the tubule. Due to the extensive reabsorption of water in the early section of the tubule, chloride ions are highly concentrated, and it is now their turn for reabsorption. They are transported into the tubule epithelial cells through the following processes:\\n\\n- *Chloride/formate anion exchangers* driven by the high concentration of chloride in the filtrate. Chloride diffuses out of the cell through channels in the cell wall, and then on into the bloodstream. \\n\\n- *Passive movement* through the spaces between epithelial cells of the tubule wall, known as tight junctions, which contrary to their name are not so tight. This is another important route for reabsorption of small solutes such as sodium chloride, and of water. Sodium continues to be reabsorbed in this part of the tubule via sodium/proton exchangers and actively transported through the tubule wall to the bloodstream by the sodium/potassium ATPase. After leaving the proximal convoluted tubule, the tubular fluid enters the proximal straight tubule, where around 15% of the phosphate is reabsorbed.\\n\\n[[\u2603 image 4]]\\n\\n*Reabsorption in the loop of Henle*: The filtrate then enters the loop of Henle (descending and ascending limbs), which is responsible for concentrating or diluting the tubular fluid using a process called countercurrent multiplication. The distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts are then largely responsible for reabsorbing water as required to produce urine at a concentration that maintains body fluid homeostasis. \\n\\n*Reabsorption in the thick ascending limb:* A further 25% of the sodium and potassium is reabsorbed through the walls of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle via:\\n\\n- *Three-ion cotransporter* (sodium/potassium/chloride) and the sodium/potassium ATPase, which as before maintains the sodium concentration gradient. Sodium is actively pumped out, while potassium and chloride diffuse down their electrochemical gradients through channels in the tubule wall and into the bloodstream. The walls of the thick ascending limb are impermeable to water, so in this section of the nephron water is not reabsorbed along with sodium.  \\n\\n[[\u2603 image 5]]\\n\\n*Reabsorption in the distal tubule and collecting duct*: The tubular fluid now enters the distal tubule and collecting duct, or terminal nephron. The early distal tubule reabsorbs a further 5% of the sodium, and the late distal tubule and collecting duct fine tune reabsorption of the last little bit (around 3%), determining exactly how much sodium will be excreted. These segments of the nephron have slightly different transporters, as well as the sodium/potassium ATPase that drives reabsorption of calcium and chloride. Sodium reabsorption in the late distal tubule and collecting duct is regulated by hormones, which stimulate or inhibit sodium reabsorption as necessary. \\n\\n*Other ions*: Calcium reabsorption throughout the nephron is largely similar to sodium reabsorption with over 99% being reabsorbed, while phosphate reabsorption is similar to that of glucose in that it primarily occurs within the proximal tubule. Reabsorption of magnesium differs in that the majority of the reabsorption occurs in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. \\n\\n# Consider the following:\\n\\n- Urine contains a diverse range of substances that are either waste products or substances ingested in excess. The importance of the kidneys in maintaining body fluid composition is clear when we look at what happens when we consider the impact on the body when our kidneys start to fail. Retention of waste products causes disturbances in multiple organ systems including cardiovascular, hematological, gastrointestinal, neurological, skeletal, hormonal, respiratory, skin and reproductive systems. Loss of water and electrolyte homeostasis lead to elevated extracellular body fluid volume, which may produce edema and hypertension, reduced phosphate excretion, loss of bone calcium, and symptoms of lethargy, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. \\n\\n- Diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder that causes you to feel very thirsty (despite drinking a lot), and to produce large amounts of urine. It is usually caused by a malfunction in the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a hormone that prevents the production of dilute urine (i.e., retains water in the body). This can happen for a number of different reasons, including damage to the pituitary; e.g., caused by a tumour, surgery, or an infection, that disrupts the normal production, storage and release of ADH. However, it may also occur due to a defect in the tubules themselves that prevents them from responding to ADH, or during pregnancy, when a placental enzyme destroys ADH in the mother. \\n\\n\\n\",\"images\":{},\"widgets\":{\"image 1\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[1283,738],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/65ec3819ed13cd8917776caae4e3102eff02edae.svg\",\"width\":1283,\"height\":738},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Overview of the nephron showing which substances get reabsorbed along the various structures of the nephron (like the proximal convoluted tubule).\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 2\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[960,560],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2a225d6f4a148d1b1da7a67da166e67051a51489.svg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":560},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Diagram showing what a proximal tubule epithelial cell looks like.\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 3\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[960,560],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/608d7b635d58626888170ead9be5c65c2b5a2d10.svg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":560},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Diagram showing how ions and other substances are reabsorbed from the nephron lumen into blood via an early proximal tubule epithelial cell.\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 4\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[960,560],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7d144442a9542474e4c1f3bcc4b9554fcc2ec4ff.svg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":560},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Diagram showing how ions and other substances are reabsorbed from the nephron lumen into blood through via a late proximal tubule epithelial cell.\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 5\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[960,560],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/63df32f7c0de36fbedb6dd8c054f09ea0a2272ac.svg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":560},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Diagram showing how ions and other substances are reabsorbed from the nephron lumen into blood via an ascending thick limb epithelial cell.\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}}}}]",

        "content": "#Dementia and Delirium (including Alzheimer\u2019s)\n\n\u201cHas anyone seen my wallet?\u201d \u201cWhat time do I have to go to the dentist?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of that movie we went to last week?\u201d We all ask these sorts of questions from time-to-time no matter our age; and not having a perfect memory is perfectly normal. It's also normal that our longer term memory, as well as our ability to remember things that only occur occasionally, fade a little as we age. Nevertheless, as we get into our sixties, many of us worry that forgetfulness or difficulty paying attention are signs of worse things to come. One of the most widespread fears as we age is dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\nBoth *dementia* (including Alzheimer\u2019s) and *delirium* are both common causes of memory loss, impaired thinking and understanding (cognition) and impaired behaviour. They are distinct disorders but may be difficult to tell apart:\n\n- Dementia is a group of symptoms that mainly affects memory, cognition and social interactions, and the ability to do everyday tasks. Symptoms start gradually often with no clear beginning, and are usually permanent. \n\n- Delirium, on the other hand, typically begins suddenly with a noticeable start point. It mainly affects attention, and often resolves after a few days or weeks, although it can last longer. \n\n##Structure, function and brain damage in dementia\n\nYour brain is your body\u2019s control centre. It is full of millions of interconnected brain cells, called neurons that receive, process, and send messages that control and coordinate almost everything that you do. Your brain is divided into three main parts, the brain stem, cerebellum and cerebrum. These different regions are responsible for different functions, such as movement, speech, sense perception, emotions, heart rate, cognition and memory. Information travels back and forth from the brain to the body along neurons, in the form of electrical impulses. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of a neuron a chemical neurotransmitter is released, which stimulates the electrical nerve impulse in the next neuron, allowing it to \u201cjump\u201d from one neuron to the next. Neurons in different parts of the brain use different neurotransmitters to transfer information. Some neurotransmitters stimulate brain activity, others calm the brain, and some do both. When your brain is functioning well, these neurotransmitters are all in balance. \n\n[[\u2603 image 1]]\n\n[[\u2603 image 2]]\n\n*Dementia* may occur anytime neurons get damaged. The damage may be anywhere within the brain, and in more than one area at the same time. Most dementias are caused by neurodegenerative diseases, most commonly Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia and  frontotemporal dementia. These diseases cause clumps of abnormal proteins to build up inside neurons, damaging them, and causing them to slowly degenerate and die. Not surprisingly, this disrupts the production of neurotransmitters and interrupts brain signals. In addition to these, vascular dementia is another common cause of progressive dementia. In this case, brain damage occurs when the blood supply to the neurons is reduced or blocked, again causing them to malfunction or die. Blood vessel damage and blockage may result during a stroke, or may be caused by high blood pressure or other blood vessel disorders. There are also several other rare neurodegenerative diseases, and many other less common causes of dementia, such as infections, or dietary deficiencies.\n\n*Delirium* is an acute, transient, and usually reversible brain malfunction. What exactly happens inside the brain of someone with delirium is not well understood; although, it is thought to be brought on by multiple neurotransmitter imbalances, which alter your normal brain activity.\n\n##Symptoms of dementia and delirium \n\nDementia symptoms affect people differently depending on the area or areas of the brain that are affected, and may be progressive or reversible depending upon the cause of the damage. Sometimes the symptoms are very similar to those of delirium, making diagnosis somewhat  tricky, and it is fairly common for a person with dementia to develop delirium. \n\n*Dementia*: symptoms usually start gradually, are fairly constant on a day-to-day basis, and slowly and steadily become worse over the course of about a decade | *Delirium*: symptoms usually appear over a few hours to a few days, and may fluctuate on and off during the day, and often occurs at night. | \n- | - | -\n**Cognitive symptoms include:**  | **Cognitive symptoms include:** |\nMemory loss | Memory Loss |\nDifficulty speaking and communicating | Difficulty speaking and communicating |\nDifficulty with complex tasks | Rambling or nonsense speech |\nDifficulty planning and organizing | Difficulty reading and writing |\nDisorientation | Disorientation |\nLoss of coordination | Wandering attention |\n | Becoming easily distracted |\n | Becoming withdrawn |\n |  |\n**Psychological symptoms include:** | **Psychological symptoms include:**|\nPersonality changes | Inability to focus |\nInability to reason | Inability to reason |\nInappropriate behaviour | Reduced awareness of the environment |\nParanoia | Agitation |\nAgitation | Hallucinations |\nHallucinations | Disturbed sleep |\nFear, anxiety, anger or depression |  |\n\nDelirium is usually transient rather than permanent, although how well you recover often depends on how well you were beforehand \u2014 if you were in good health before it happened, you are more likely to have a full recovery. Unfortunately, for some people, particularly those who are critically ill, delirium may lead to significant memory loss and decrease in thinking skills, as well as a general decline in health, poor recovery and increased risk of death.\n\n[[\u2603 image 3]]\n\n##What causes dementia and delirium?\n\n###Dementia\n\nFour diseases account for most cases of dementia: Alzheimer\u2019s disease (about 50-60% of cases), vascular dementia (about 15-20% of cases), Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia.$^1$ Each of these have different characteristics:\n\n- *Alzheimer\u2019s* symptoms usually start in your mid to late 60s, although a small proportion of people get early onset Alzheimer's, with symptoms starting in their 40s or 50s. This form of Alzheimer\u2019s has a strong genetic link and typically runs in families.\n- *Vascular dementia* is rare if you are under 65, but usually starts more suddenly than Alzheimer\u2019s. Diagnosis may be complicated by the fact that you have Alzheimer\u2019s or another dementia at the same time. People at risk for vascular dementia often have a history of smoking, cardiac dysrhythmia, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.\n- *Lewy body dementia*: Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of protein that build up in neurons causing brain signalling malfunctions; they are often found in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease (primarily a movement disorder). Lewy body dementia is similar to Alzheimer\u2019s, but can be distinguished by unique symptoms such as rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, and fluctuations between confusion and clarity.\n- *Frontotemporal dementia* often has an earlier onset than Alzheimer\u2019s, generally in your 50s or early 60s. The brain damage occurs at the front of your brain in regions that control personality, behaviour, and language.\n\nExactly why we get these dementias remains a puzzle, although there are likely genetic links in many cases. Other rare conditions have also been linked to dementia including Huntington\u2019s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease, as well as traumatic brain injury.\n\nAdditionally, there are a variety of other reasons you may get dementia when the symptoms are often reversible. These include infections (e.g., meningitis, or syphilis), nutritional deficiencies, reactions to medications, brain bleeds, substance abuse, and poisoning. It is also possible that malfunction of other vital organs including the liver or kidneys can disrupt brain function causing dementia. \n\nAs an older adult, any condition that ends up in a visit to the hospital increases your risk for delirium, and up to 80% of people who are critically ill will be delirious at some time during their hospital stay.$^2$ There are many different conditions that can trigger delirium with most common including dehydration, acute infections, such as urinary tract infection or pneumonia, prescribed drugs including antidepressants, sleeping pills and narcotics, and alcohol or substance abuse or withdrawal.  \n\n[[\u2603 image 4]]\n\n##How many people have dementia and delirium?\n\n*Dementia*: Worldwide, there are around 50 million people living with dementia, and with 8 million new cases every year; as the average lifespan is steadily increasing, dementia is increasing fast in many countries.$^3$ Overall, almost 1 in 10 people over the age of 60 have dementia, and the prevalence increases rapidly with age.$^1$ Women are at slightly more risk for it than men, and your chances increase if you are obese, have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other cardiovascular risk factors.$^1$  \n\n[[\u2603 image 5]]\n\n*Delirium*: Delirium is very common in the hospital setting, especially when you are older and unwell. In fact, almost half of older patients are delirious when they are admitted, or develop delirium while they are there.2 Like dementia, delirium increases significantly with age.4 In contrast to dementia, delirium is a little more common among men than women.\n\n##Are there ways to prevent dementia and delirium?\n\n*Dementia*: We don\u2019t know for sure how to prevent dementia, but a healthy active lifestyle that includes keeping your mind and body active, and that keeps you socially connected may be of benefit. Other steps you can take that may also reduce your risk are to quit smoking, lower your blood pressure, and eat a healthy diet that maintains a good balance of nutrients and vitamins, all of which may indirectly reduce your risk.\n\n*Delirium*: The best way to prevent delirium is to remove the triggers. In a hospital setting this could include systems that maintain as calm and quiet an environment as possible, while providing the individualized support and medical care that is necessary, and when possible avoiding medications known to trigger delirium. \n\n##What are the treatments for dementia and delirium?\n\n*Dementia*: Memory loss and other symptoms of dementia may have many causes, so after reviewing your medical history, and symptoms, your doctor will likely want you to undergo other tests to evaluate your thinking and movement skills, and possibly your mental health. In addition to this, you may need a brain scan to check to see if you have had a stroke or brain bleed, or whether or not you have a brain tumour, as well as various laboratory tests to check for any metabolic and nutritional problems. \n\nMost types of dementia are incurable, but there are medications that regulate brain chemicals involved in brain functions including memory, judgement, and learning that may be helpful with controlling or reducing your symptoms. Two of the more commonly prescribed types of medicine are cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, which is the first in a new class of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s. Other medications are also available to treat any accompanying symptoms, and occupational therapists are experts at helping with strategies that improve coping with day-to-day challenges and quality of life.   \n\n*Delirium*: Your doctor will likely follow a similar process to that outlined above for dementia, to decide whether or not you are delirious. If you are, your treatment will be aimed at eliminating the underlying cause or causes, which for example could include treating an infection, or stopping or changing a particular medicine that you are taking to treat something else. Your doctor may also recommend additional supportive care, to ensure you stay hydrated, treat any pain you may have, keep you oriented with your surroundings, and help you get up and about again.\n\n##Consider the following:\n\nMemantine is the first drug in a new class of drugs (called N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, or NMDA receptor antagonists) that has been approved to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. While cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s help raise the levels of the neurotransmitter known as acetylcholine, memantine works by regulating a chemical called glutamate. Glutamate is the salt of glutamic acid. It is an essential amino acid that is involved in many chemical processes that occur in living organisms, that lead to growth, production of energy, and elimination of waste. In the brain however, glutamate is an important neurotransmitter that\u2019s involved in regulating almost everything your brain does including memory, cognition, and learning. For your brain to work well, glutamate has to be in the right place, at the right time, and in the right amount \u2014 too much or too little glutamate is harmful. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, excess glutamate accumulates when neurons get damaged, which can be devastating for functioning neurons. Memantine works by blocking the effects of too much glutamate, preventing cell death, and delaying some of the symptoms of moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Because memantine has a different mechanism of action, it may be used in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors, which may improve outcomes for longer periods of time.\n\n[[\u2603 explanation 1]]\n",

It's also normal that our longer term memory, as well as our ability to remember things that only occur occasionally, fade a little as we age. Nevertheless, as we get into our sixties, many of us worry that forgetfulness or difficulty paying attention are signs of worse things to come. One of the most widespread fears as we age is dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \\n\\nBoth *dementia* (including Alzheimer\u2019s) and *delirium* are both common causes of memory loss, impaired thinking and understanding (cognition) and impaired behaviour. They are distinct disorders but may be difficult to tell apart:\\n\\n- Dementia is a group of symptoms that mainly affects memory, cognition and social interactions, and the ability to do everyday tasks. Symptoms start gradually often with no clear beginning, and are usually permanent. \\n\\n- Delirium, on the other hand, typically begins suddenly with a noticeable start point. It mainly affects attention, and often resolves after a few days or weeks, although it can last longer. \\n\\n##Structure, function and brain damage in dementia\\n\\nYour brain is your body\u2019s control centre. It is full of millions of interconnected brain cells, called neurons that receive, process, and send messages that control and coordinate almost everything that you do. Your brain is divided into three main parts, the brain stem, cerebellum and cerebrum. These different regions are responsible for different functions, such as movement, speech, sense perception, emotions, heart rate, cognition and memory. Information travels back and forth from the brain to the body along neurons, in the form of electrical impulses. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of a neuron a chemical neurotransmitter is released, which stimulates the electrical nerve impulse in the next neuron, allowing it to \u201cjump\u201d from one neuron to the next. Neurons in different parts of the brain use different neurotransmitters to transfer information. Some neurotransmitters stimulate brain activity, others calm the brain, and some do both. When your brain is functioning well, these neurotransmitters are all in balance. \\n\\n[[\u2603 image 1]]\\n\\n[[\u2603 image 2]]\\n\\n*Dementia* may occur anytime neurons get damaged. The damage may be anywhere within the brain, and in more than one area at the same time. Most dementias are caused by neurodegenerative diseases, most commonly Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia and  frontotemporal dementia. These diseases cause clumps of abnormal proteins to build up inside neurons, damaging them, and causing them to slowly degenerate and die. Not surprisingly, this disrupts the production of neurotransmitters and interrupts brain signals. In addition to these, vascular dementia is another common cause of progressive dementia. In this case, brain damage occurs when the blood supply to the neurons is reduced or blocked, again causing them to malfunction or die. Blood vessel damage and blockage may result during a stroke, or may be caused by high blood pressure or other blood vessel disorders. There are also several other rare neurodegenerative diseases, and many other less common causes of dementia, such as infections, or dietary deficiencies.\\n\\n*Delirium* is an acute, transient, and usually reversible brain malfunction. What exactly happens inside the brain of someone with delirium is not well understood; although, it is thought to be brought on by multiple neurotransmitter imbalances, which alter your normal brain activity.\\n\\n##Symptoms of dementia and delirium \\n\\nDementia symptoms affect people differently depending on the area or areas of the brain that are affected, and may be progressive or reversible depending upon the cause of the damage. Sometimes the symptoms are very similar to those of delirium, making diagnosis somewhat  tricky, and it is fairly common for a person with dementia to develop delirium. \\n\\n*Dementia*: symptoms usually start gradually, are fairly constant on a day-to-day basis, and slowly and steadily become worse over the course of about a decade | *Delirium*: symptoms usually appear over a few hours to a few days, and may fluctuate on and off during the day, and often occurs at night. | \\n- | - | -\\n**Cognitive symptoms include:**  | **Cognitive symptoms include:** |\\nMemory loss | Memory Loss |\\nDifficulty speaking and communicating | Difficulty speaking and communicating |\\nDifficulty with complex tasks | Rambling or nonsense speech |\\nDifficulty planning and organizing | Difficulty reading and writing |\\nDisorientation | Disorientation |\\nLoss of coordination | Wandering attention |\\n | Becoming easily distracted |\\n | Becoming withdrawn |\\n |  |\\n**Psychological symptoms include:** | **Psychological symptoms include:**|\\nPersonality changes | Inability to focus |\\nInability to reason | Inability to reason |\\nInappropriate behaviour | Reduced awareness of the environment |\\nParanoia | Agitation |\\nAgitation | Hallucinations |\\nHallucinations | Disturbed sleep |\\nFear, anxiety, anger or depression |  |\\n\\nDelirium is usually transient rather than permanent, although how well you recover often depends on how well you were beforehand \u2014 if you were in good health before it happened, you are more likely to have a full recovery. Unfortunately, for some people, particularly those who are critically ill, delirium may lead to significant memory loss and decrease in thinking skills, as well as a general decline in health, poor recovery and increased risk of death.\\n\\n[[\u2603 image 3]]\\n\\n##What causes dementia and delirium?\\n\\n###Dementia\\n\\nFour diseases account for most cases of dementia: Alzheimer\u2019s disease (about 50-60% of cases), vascular dementia (about 15-20% of cases), Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia.$^1$ Each of these have different characteristics:\\n\\n- *Alzheimer\u2019s* symptoms usually start in your mid to late 60s, although a small proportion of people get early onset Alzheimer's, with symptoms starting in their 40s or 50s. This form of Alzheimer\u2019s has a strong genetic link and typically runs in families.\\n- *Vascular dementia* is rare if you are under 65, but usually starts more suddenly than Alzheimer\u2019s. Diagnosis may be complicated by the fact that you have Alzheimer\u2019s or another dementia at the same time. People at risk for vascular dementia often have a history of smoking, cardiac dysrhythmia, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.\\n- *Lewy body dementia*: Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of protein that build up in neurons causing brain signalling malfunctions; they are often found in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease (primarily a movement disorder). Lewy body dementia is similar to Alzheimer\u2019s, but can be distinguished by unique symptoms such as rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, and fluctuations between confusion and clarity.\\n- *Frontotemporal dementia* often has an earlier onset than Alzheimer\u2019s, generally in your 50s or early 60s. The brain damage occurs at the front of your brain in regions that control personality, behaviour, and language.\\n\\nExactly why we get these dementias remains a puzzle, although there are likely genetic links in many cases. Other rare conditions have also been linked to dementia including Huntington\u2019s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease, as well as traumatic brain injury.\\n\\nAdditionally, there are a variety of other reasons you may get dementia when the symptoms are often reversible. These include infections (e.g., meningitis, or syphilis), nutritional deficiencies, reactions to medications, brain bleeds, substance abuse, and poisoning. It is also possible that malfunction of other vital organs including the liver or kidneys can disrupt brain function causing dementia. \\n\\nAs an older adult, any condition that ends up in a visit to the hospital increases your risk for delirium, and up to 80% of people who are critically ill will be delirious at some time during their hospital stay.$^2$ There are many different conditions that can trigger delirium with most common including dehydration, acute infections, such as urinary tract infection or pneumonia, prescribed drugs including antidepressants, sleeping pills and narcotics, and alcohol or substance abuse or withdrawal.  \\n\\n[[\u2603 image 4]]\\n\\n##How many people have dementia and delirium?\\n\\n*Dementia*: Worldwide, there are around 50 million people living with dementia, and with 8 million new cases every year; as the average lifespan is steadily increasing, dementia is increasing fast in many countries.$^3$ Overall, almost 1 in 10 people over the age of 60 have dementia, and the prevalence increases rapidly with age.$^1$ Women are at slightly more risk for it than men, and your chances increase if you are obese, have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other cardiovascular risk factors.$^1$  \\n\\n[[\u2603 image 5]]\\n\\n*Delirium*: Delirium is very common in the hospital setting, especially when you are older and unwell. In fact, almost half of older patients are delirious when they are admitted, or develop delirium while they are there.2 Like dementia, delirium increases significantly with age.4 In contrast to dementia, delirium is a little more common among men than women.\\n\\n##Are there ways to prevent dementia and delirium?\\n\\n*Dementia*: We don\u2019t know for sure how to prevent dementia, but a healthy active lifestyle that includes keeping your mind and body active, and that keeps you socially connected may be of benefit. Other steps you can take that may also reduce your risk are to quit smoking, lower your blood pressure, and eat a healthy diet that maintains a good balance of nutrients and vitamins, all of which may indirectly reduce your risk.\\n\\n*Delirium*: The best way to prevent delirium is to remove the triggers. In a hospital setting this could include systems that maintain as calm and quiet an environment as possible, while providing the individualized support and medical care that is necessary, and when possible avoiding medications known to trigger delirium. \\n\\n##What are the treatments for dementia and delirium?\\n\\n*Dementia*: Memory loss and other symptoms of dementia may have many causes, so after reviewing your medical history, and symptoms, your doctor will likely want you to undergo other tests to evaluate your thinking and movement skills, and possibly your mental health. In addition to this, you may need a brain scan to check to see if you have had a stroke or brain bleed, or whether or not you have a brain tumour, as well as various laboratory tests to check for any metabolic and nutritional problems. \\n\\nMost types of dementia are incurable, but there are medications that regulate brain chemicals involved in brain functions including memory, judgement, and learning that may be helpful with controlling or reducing your symptoms. Two of the more commonly prescribed types of medicine are cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, which is the first in a new class of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s. Other medications are also available to treat any accompanying symptoms, and occupational therapists are experts at helping with strategies that improve coping with day-to-day challenges and quality of life.   \\n\\n*Delirium*: Your doctor will likely follow a similar process to that outlined above for dementia, to decide whether or not you are delirious. If you are, your treatment will be aimed at eliminating the underlying cause or causes, which for example could include treating an infection, or stopping or changing a particular medicine that you are taking to treat something else. Your doctor may also recommend additional supportive care, to ensure you stay hydrated, treat any pain you may have, keep you oriented with your surroundings, and help you get up and about again.\\n\\n##Consider the following:\\n\\nMemantine is the first drug in a new class of drugs (called N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, or NMDA receptor antagonists) that has been approved to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. While cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s help raise the levels of the neurotransmitter known as acetylcholine, memantine works by regulating a chemical called glutamate. Glutamate is the salt of glutamic acid. It is an essential amino acid that is involved in many chemical processes that occur in living organisms, that lead to growth, production of energy, and elimination of waste. In the brain however, glutamate is an important neurotransmitter that\u2019s involved in regulating almost everything your brain does including memory, cognition, and learning. For your brain to work well, glutamate has to be in the right place, at the right time, and in the right amount \u2014 too much or too little glutamate is harmful. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, excess glutamate accumulates when neurons get damaged, which can be devastating for functioning neurons. Memantine works by blocking the effects of too much glutamate, preventing cell death, and delaying some of the symptoms of moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Because memantine has a different mechanism of action, it may be used in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors, which may improve outcomes for longer periods of time.\\n\\n[[\u2603 explanation 1]]\\n\",\"images\":{},\"widgets\":{\"image 1\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[792,612],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bc428e7f258ecf832efd99a627c04ad4318257e3.svg\",\"width\":792,\"height\":612},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Diagram showing regions of the brain affected by dementia\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 2\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[792,485],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fe40a24e03cbe4ce73f07d05f64ee03d8c99539e.svg\",\"width\":792,\"height\":485},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Image of neurotransmitters traveling across a synapse\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 3\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[792,612],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/49b50617d2323f06d894e626584e0c7e2d6484f9.svg\",\"width\":792,\"height\":612},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"A diagram that details what each region of the brain controls\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 4\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[792,612],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/30731193b12bd65e193c3d9ebe061e7ae945305c.svg\",\"width\":792,\"height\":612},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"A diagram showing the causes of dementia and delirium\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 5\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[612,792],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a75957f074f40233e537f09d86af9fbb8974dbb2.svg\",\"width\":612,\"height\":792},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"A graph illustrating the predicted number of cases of dementia in various regions of the world.\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"explanation 1\":{\"type\":\"explanation\",\"alignment\":\"default\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"showPrompt\":\"Attributes and References\",\"hidePrompt\":\"Hide references\",\"explanation\":\"##Attributes\\n\\nThis article is licensed under a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\\n\\n#References\\n\\n1.

        "content": "##What does buoyant force mean?\n\nHave you ever dropped your swimming goggles in the deepest part of the pool and tried to swim down to get them? It can be frustrating because the water tries to push you back up to the surface as you're swimming downward. The name of this upward force exerted on objects submerged in fluids is called the **buoyant force**. \n\nSo why do fluids exert an upward buoyant force on submerged objects? It has to do with differences in pressure between the bottom of the submerged object and the top. Say someone dropped a can of beans in a pool of water. [[\u2603 explanation 1]]\n\n[[\u2603 image 1]]\n\nBecause pressure $(P_{gauge}=\\rho gh)$ increases as you go deeper in a fluid, the force from pressure exerted downward on the top of the can of beans will be less than the force from pressure exerted upward on the bottom of the can.  \n\nEssentially it's that simple. The reason there's a buoyant force is because of the rather unavoidable fact that the bottom (i.e. more submerged part) of an object is always deeper in a fluid than the top of the object. This means the upward force from water has to be greater than the downward force from water.  \n[[\u2603 explanation 2]]\n\nKnowing conceptually why there should be a buoyant force is good, but we should also be able to figure out how to determine the exact size of the buoyant force as well. \n\nWe can start with the fact that the water on the top of the can is pushing down $F_{down}$, and the water on the bottom of the can is pushing up $F_{up}$. We can find the total upward force on the can exerted by water pressure (which we call the buoyant force $F_{buoyant}$) by simply taking the difference between the magnitudes of the upward force $F_{up}$ and downward force $F_{down}$. \n\n$F_{buoyant} =F_{up} - F_{down}$\n\nWe can relate these forces to the pressure by using the definition of pressure $P=\\dfrac{F}{A}$ which can be solved for force to get $F=PA$ . So the force exerted upward on the bottom of the can will be $F_{up}=P_{bottom}A$ and the force exerted downward on the top of the can will be $F_{down}=P_{top}A$. Substituting these expressions in for each $F$ respectively in the previous equation we get,\n\n$ F_{buoyant} =P_{bottom} A - P_{top}A$\n\nWe can use the formula for hydrostatic gauge pressure $P_{gauge}=\\rho gh$ to find expressions for the upward and downward directed pressures. The force from pressure directed upward on the bottom of the can is $P_{bottom}=\\rho gh_{bottom}$ and the force from pressure directed downward on the top of the can is $P_{top}=\\rho gh_{top}$ . We can substitute these into the previous equation for each pressure respectively to get,\n\n$F_{buoyant} =(\\rho gh_{bottom}) A - (\\rho gh_{top})A$\n\nNotice that each term in this equation contains the expression $\\rho g A$. So we can simplify this formula by pulling out a common factor of $\\rho g A$ to get,\n\n$F_{buoyant} =\\rho gA(h_{bottom} -h_{top})$\n\nNow this term $h_{bottom} -h_{top}$ is important and something interesting is about to happen because of it. The difference between the depth of the bottom of the can $h_{bottom}$ and the depth of the top of the can $h_{top}$ is just equal to the height of the can. (see the digram below)  \n\n[[\u2603 image 2]]\n\nSo we can replace $(h_{bottom} -h_{top})$ in the previous formula with the height of the can $h_{can}$ to get,\n\n$F_{buoyant} =\\rho gAh_{can}$\n\nHere's the interesting part. Since $A \\times h$ is equal to the volume of a cylinder, we can replace the term $Ah_{can}$ with a volume $V$ . The first instinct might be to associate this volume with the volume of the can. But notice that this volume will also be equal to the volume of the water displaced by the can. By displaced water we mean the volume of water that was once in the volume of space now occupied by the can. [[\u2603 explanation 4]]\n\nSo we are definitely going to replace the term $Ah$ with a volume $V$ , but should we write this volume as *volume of the can* or *volume of the displaced fluid*? This is important  because the two volumes could be different if the object is only partially submerged in the fluid. The short answer is that we need to use the volume of the fluid displaced $V_{fluid}$ in the formula because the displaced fluid is the factor that determines the buoyant force. [[\u2603 explanation 3]]\n\n$\\Large F_{buoyant} =\\rho gV_{f}$\n\nThat pretty much does it. This formula gives the buoyant force on a can of beans (or any other object) submerged wholly or partially in a fluid. Let's take stock of what we have now. Notice how the buoyant force only depends on the density of the fluid $\\rho$ in which the object is submerged, the acceleration due to gravity $g$, and the volume of the displaced fluid $V_f$. \n\nSurprisingly the buoyant force doesn't depend on the overall depth of the object submerged. In other words, as long as the can of beans is fully submerged, bringing it to a deeper and deeper depth will not change the buoyant force. This might seem strange since the pressure gets larger as you descend to deeper depths. But the key idea is that the pressures at the top and bottom of the can will both increase by the same amount and therefore cancel, leaving the total buoyant force the same. \n\nSomething might strike you as being wrong about all this. Some objects definitely sink, but we just proved that there is an upward force on every submerged object. How can an object sink if it has an upward force on it? Well, there is definitely an upward buoyant force on every submerged object, even those that sink. It's just that for sinking objects, their weight is greater than the buoyant force. If their weight was less than their buoyant force they would float. It turns out that it's possible to prove that if the density of a fully submerged object (regardless of its shape) is greater than the density of the fluid it's placed in, the object will sink.

It turns out that no matter what shape you make your object, the net force from water pressure will always point upward. For the example of the cone, the tapered sides make it so that a component of the pressure on the sides also points up which makes it so the net buoyant force again points upward.   \n![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/43a19ca25476ca65b19239d32f640ba208317593.png)  \n\nIt's fun to try and think of more examples of other shapes, and then try to figure out why they won't make the buoyant force point downward.",

The term $\\rho V_f$ is the density of the displaced fluid multiplied by the volume of the displaced fluid. Since the definition of density $\\rho=\\dfrac{m}{V}$ can be rearranged into $m=\\rho V$, that means the term $\\rho V_f$ corresponds to the mass of the displaced fluid. So, if we wanted to, we could replace the term $\\rho V_f$ with $m_f$ in the previous equation to get,\n\n$F_{buoyant} =m_{f}g$\n\nBut look at that! The mass of the displaced fluid times the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity is just the weight of the displaced fluid. So remarkably, we can rewrite the formula for the buoyant force as,\n\n$F_{buoyant} =W_f$\n\nThis equation, when stated in words, is called Archimedes' principle. Archimedes' principle is the statement that **the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object**. The simplicity and power of this idea is striking. If you want to know the buoyant force on an object, you only need to determine the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. [[\u2603 explanation 5]]\n\nThe fact that simple and beautiful (yet not obvious) ideas like this result from a logical progression of basic physics principles is part of why people find physics so useful, powerful, and interesting.

It can be frustrating because the water tries to push you back up to the surface as you're swimming downward. The name of this upward force exerted on objects submerged in fluids is called the **buoyant force**. \\n\\nSo why do fluids exert an upward buoyant force on submerged objects? It has to do with differences in pressure between the bottom of the submerged object and the top. Say someone dropped a can of beans in a pool of water. [[\u2603 explanation 1]]\\n\\n[[\u2603 image 1]]\\n\\nBecause pressure $(P_{gauge}=\\\\rho gh)$ increases as you go deeper in a fluid, the force from pressure exerted downward on the top of the can of beans will be less than the force from pressure exerted upward on the bottom of the can.  \\n\\nEssentially it's that simple. The reason there's a buoyant force is because of the rather unavoidable fact that the bottom (i.e. more submerged part) of an object is always deeper in a fluid than the top of the object. This means the upward force from water has to be greater than the downward force from water.  \\n[[\u2603 explanation 2]]\\n\\nKnowing conceptually why there should be a buoyant force is good, but we should also be able to figure out how to determine the exact size of the buoyant force as well. \\n\\nWe can start with the fact that the water on the top of the can is pushing down $F_{down}$, and the water on the bottom of the can is pushing up $F_{up}$. We can find the total upward force on the can exerted by water pressure (which we call the buoyant force $F_{buoyant}$) by simply taking the difference between the magnitudes of the upward force $F_{up}$ and downward force $F_{down}$. \\n\\n$F_{buoyant} =F_{up} - F_{down}$\\n\\nWe can relate these forces to the pressure by using the definition of pressure $P=\\\\dfrac{F}{A}$ which can be solved for force to get $F=PA$ . So the force exerted upward on the bottom of the can will be $F_{up}=P_{bottom}A$ and the force exerted downward on the top of the can will be $F_{down}=P_{top}A$. Substituting these expressions in for each $F$ respectively in the previous equation we get,\\n\\n$ F_{buoyant} =P_{bottom} A - P_{top}A$\\n\\nWe can use the formula for hydrostatic gauge pressure $P_{gauge}=\\\\rho gh$ to find expressions for the upward and downward directed pressures. The force from pressure directed upward on the bottom of the can is $P_{bottom}=\\\\rho gh_{bottom}$ and the force from pressure directed downward on the top of the can is $P_{top}=\\\\rho gh_{top}$ . We can substitute these into the previous equation for each pressure respectively to get,\\n\\n$F_{buoyant} =(\\\\rho gh_{bottom}) A - (\\\\rho gh_{top})A$\\n\\nNotice that each term in this equation contains the expression $\\\\rho g A$. So we can simplify this formula by pulling out a common factor of $\\\\rho g A$ to get,\\n\\n$F_{buoyant} =\\\\rho gA(h_{bottom} -h_{top})$\\n\\nNow this term $h_{bottom} -h_{top}$ is important and something interesting is about to happen because of it. The difference between the depth of the bottom of the can $h_{bottom}$ and the depth of the top of the can $h_{top}$ is just equal to the height of the can. (see the digram below)  \\n\\n[[\u2603 image 2]]\\n\\nSo we can replace $(h_{bottom} -h_{top})$ in the previous formula with the height of the can $h_{can}$ to get,\\n\\n$F_{buoyant} =\\\\rho gAh_{can}$\\n\\nHere's the interesting part. Since $A \\\\times h$ is equal to the volume of a cylinder, we can replace the term $Ah_{can}$ with a volume $V$ . The first instinct might be to associate this volume with the volume of the can. But notice that this volume will also be equal to the volume of the water displaced by the can. By displaced water we mean the volume of water that was once in the volume of space now occupied by the can. [[\u2603 explanation 4]]\\n\\nSo we are definitely going to replace the term $Ah$ with a volume $V$ , but should we write this volume as *volume of the can* or *volume of the displaced fluid*? This is important  because the two volumes could be different if the object is only partially submerged in the fluid. The short answer is that we need to use the volume of the fluid displaced $V_{fluid}$ in the formula because the displaced fluid is the factor that determines the buoyant force. [[\u2603 explanation 3]]\\n\\n$\\\\Large F_{buoyant} =\\\\rho gV_{f}$\\n\\nThat pretty much does it. This formula gives the buoyant force on a can of beans (or any other object) submerged wholly or partially in a fluid. Let's take stock of what we have now. Notice how the buoyant force only depends on the density of the fluid $\\\\rho$ in which the object is submerged, the acceleration due to gravity $g$, and the volume of the displaced fluid $V_f$. \\n\\nSurprisingly the buoyant force doesn't depend on the overall depth of the object submerged. In other words, as long as the can of beans is fully submerged, bringing it to a deeper and deeper depth will not change the buoyant force. This might seem strange since the pressure gets larger as you descend to deeper depths. But the key idea is that the pressures at the top and bottom of the can will both increase by the same amount and therefore cancel, leaving the total buoyant force the same. \\n\\nSomething might strike you as being wrong about all this. Some objects definitely sink, but we just proved that there is an upward force on every submerged object. How can an object sink if it has an upward force on it? Well, there is definitely an upward buoyant force on every submerged object, even those that sink. It's just that for sinking objects, their weight is greater than the buoyant force. If their weight was less than their buoyant force they would float. It turns out that it's possible to prove that if the density of a fully submerged object (regardless of its shape) is greater than the density of the fluid it's placed in, the object will sink.

Archimedes' principle is the statement that **the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object**. The simplicity and power of this idea is striking. If you want to know the buoyant force on an object, you only need to determine the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

        "content": "Brain cells called neurons send information and instructions throughout the brain and body. The information is sent via electro-chemical signals known as action potentials that travel down the length of the neuron. These neurons are then triggered to release chemical messengers called neurotransmitters which help trigger action potentials in nearby cells, and so help spread the signal all over.\n\nHowever, not all information is equally important or urgent. Especially when it comes to sensations such as touch and position sense, there are some signals that your body needs to tell your brain about *right now*, and some that can wait a little while to be processed. For example, pain from a shallow cut travels faster than pain originating in your liver. This means that different types of information will be sent on different types of neurons.\n \n## Some Signal Are Very Fast\n\nImagine you are walking along and suddenly you trip and begin to fall. Luckily, your body senses that your limbs are in the wrong place and instead of falling to the ground, you just stumble a little. This sense of knowing where you are in space is known as **proprioception**, and the nerves that transmit this information are among the fastest in your body! This is because they have two special characteristics that allow them send information very quickly \u2013 a large diameter, and a myelin sheath.\n\n[[\u2603 image 1]]\n\n## Size\n\nAction potentials travel down neuronal axons in an ion cascade. Positive ions (mostly sodium ions) flow into the cell body, which triggers transmembrane channels at the start of the axon to open and to let in more positive ions. These new positive ions trigger the channels next to them, which let in even more positive ions. This continues down the axon and creates the action potential.\n\nLarger diameter axons have a higher conduction velocity, which means they are able to send signals faster. This is because there is less resistance facing the ion flow. We have a lot of ions flooding into the axon, so the more space they have to travel, the more likely they will be able to keep going in the right direction. An axon is still part of the cell, so it\u2019s full of cytoplasmic proteins, vesicles, etc. The larger the diameter of the axon, the less likely the incoming ions will run into something that could bounce them back.\n\nThe action potential depends on positive ions continually traveling away from the cell body, and that is much easier in a larger axon. A smaller axon, like the ones found in nerves that conduct pain, would make it much harder for ions to move down the cell because they would keep bumping into other molecules.\n\n[[\u2603 image 2]]\n\n## Sheath\n\nThe second way to speed up a signal in an axon is to insulate it with myelin, a fatty substance. In the peripheral nervous system, myelin is found  in Schwann cell membranes. In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes are responsible for insulation. These cells wrap around the axon, creating several layers insulation. As our action potential travels down the membrane, sometimes ions are lost as they cross the membrane and exit the cell. The presence of myelin makes this escape pretty much impossible, and so helps to preserve the action potential.\n\nA myelin sheath also decreases the capacitance of the neuron in the area it covers. Since the neuron is at a negative membrane potential, it\u2019s got a lot of agitated negative ions that don\u2019t have a positive ion nearby to balance them out. Like charges repel, so the negative ions spread out as far from each other as they can, to the very outer edges of the axon, near the membrane. This then attracts positive ions outside the cell to the membrane as well, and helps the ions in a way, calm down. We then end up with thin layers of negative ions inside of the cell membrane and positive ions outside the cell membrane.\nHowever, where myelin wraps around the cell, it provides a thick layer between the inside and the outside of the cell.  Fewer negative ions gather at those points because it is further away from the positive charges. Now there are parts of the axon that are still negative, but contain proportionally far fewer negative ions. This means that as the action potential comes rushing by, it is easier to depolarize the areas that are sheathed, because there are fewer negative ions to counteract.\n\n[[\u2603 image 3]]\n\nThe spaces between the myelin sheaths are known as the nodes of Ranvier. These areas are brimming with voltage-gated ion channels to help push the signal along. Since these areas are unsheathed, it is also where the positive ions gather, to help balance out the negative ions. When the channels open, there are plenty of positive ions waiting to swarm inside. It almost looks like the signal jumps from node to node, in a process known as **saltatory conduction**. To saltate means to move by leaps or jumps, like the action potential seems to do down the axon. In reality, the internal current of flowing positive ions is activating the opening of the gates down the axon.\n\n[[\u2603 image 4]]\n\n## Consider the Following:\n\n* Pain is actually one of the slowest sensations our bodies can send. Smaller fibers without myelin, like the ones carrying pain information, carry signals at about 0.5-2.0 m/s (1.1-4.5 miles per hour). The fastest signals in our bodies are sent by larger, myelinated axons found in neurons that transmit the sense of touch or proprioception \u2013 80-120 m/s (179-268 miles per hour). Scientists believe that this reflects the evolution of these senses - pain was among the most important things to sense, and so was the first to develop through small, simple nerves. More nuanced senses like vibration and light touch evolved later, in larger, more complex structures.\n\n* Demyelination diseases that degrade the myelin coating on cells include Guillain-Barre syndrome and Multiple Sclerosis. Guillain-Barre syndrome is the destruction of Schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system), while MS is caused by a loss of oligodendrocytes (in the brain and spinal column). These disorders have different causes and presentations, but both involve muscle weakness and numbness or tingling. These symptoms occur because the nerves aren\u2019t sending information the right way. When the myelin coating of nerves degenerates, the signals are either diminished or completely destroyed. If the nerves are afferent (sensory) fibers, the destruction of myelin leads to numbness or tingling, because sensations aren\u2019t traveling the way they should. When efferent (motor) nerves are demyelinated, this can lead to weakness because the brain is expending a lot of energy but is still unable to actually move the affected limbs. Limbs are especially affected, because they have the longest nerves, and the longer the nerve, the more myelin it has that can potentially be destroyed.\n\n[[\u2603 explanation 1]]\n",

The information is sent via electro-chemical signals known as action potentials that travel down the length of the neuron. These neurons are then triggered to release chemical messengers called neurotransmitters which help trigger action potentials in nearby cells, and so help spread the signal all over.\\n\\nHowever, not all information is equally important or urgent. Especially when it comes to sensations such as touch and position sense, there are some signals that your body needs to tell your brain about *right now*, and some that can wait a little while to be processed. For example, pain from a shallow cut travels faster than pain originating in your liver. This means that different types of information will be sent on different types of neurons.\\n \\n## Some Signal Are Very Fast\\n\\nImagine you are walking along and suddenly you trip and begin to fall. Luckily, your body senses that your limbs are in the wrong place and instead of falling to the ground, you just stumble a little. This sense of knowing where you are in space is known as **proprioception**, and the nerves that transmit this information are among the fastest in your body! This is because they have two special characteristics that allow them send information very quickly \u2013 a large diameter, and a myelin sheath.\\n\\n[[\u2603 image 1]]\\n\\n## Size\\n\\nAction potentials travel down neuronal axons in an ion cascade. Positive ions (mostly sodium ions) flow into the cell body, which triggers transmembrane channels at the start of the axon to open and to let in more positive ions. These new positive ions trigger the channels next to them, which let in even more positive ions. This continues down the axon and creates the action potential.\\n\\nLarger diameter axons have a higher conduction velocity, which means they are able to send signals faster. This is because there is less resistance facing the ion flow. We have a lot of ions flooding into the axon, so the more space they have to travel, the more likely they will be able to keep going in the right direction. An axon is still part of the cell, so it\u2019s full of cytoplasmic proteins, vesicles, etc. The larger the diameter of the axon, the less likely the incoming ions will run into something that could bounce them back.\\n\\nThe action potential depends on positive ions continually traveling away from the cell body, and that is much easier in a larger axon. A smaller axon, like the ones found in nerves that conduct pain, would make it much harder for ions to move down the cell because they would keep bumping into other molecules.\\n\\n[[\u2603 image 2]]\\n\\n## Sheath\\n\\nThe second way to speed up a signal in an axon is to insulate it with myelin, a fatty substance. In the peripheral nervous system, myelin is found  in Schwann cell membranes. In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes are responsible for insulation. These cells wrap around the axon, creating several layers insulation. As our action potential travels down the membrane, sometimes ions are lost as they cross the membrane and exit the cell. The presence of myelin makes this escape pretty much impossible, and so helps to preserve the action potential.\\n\\nA myelin sheath also decreases the capacitance of the neuron in the area it covers. Since the neuron is at a negative membrane potential, it\u2019s got a lot of agitated negative ions that don\u2019t have a positive ion nearby to balance them out. Like charges repel, so the negative ions spread out as far from each other as they can, to the very outer edges of the axon, near the membrane. This then attracts positive ions outside the cell to the membrane as well, and helps the ions in a way, calm down. We then end up with thin layers of negative ions inside of the cell membrane and positive ions outside the cell membrane.\\nHowever, where myelin wraps around the cell, it provides a thick layer between the inside and the outside of the cell.  Fewer negative ions gather at those points because it is further away from the positive charges. Now there are parts of the axon that are still negative, but contain proportionally far fewer negative ions. This means that as the action potential comes rushing by, it is easier to depolarize the areas that are sheathed, because there are fewer negative ions to counteract.\\n\\n[[\u2603 image 3]]\\n\\nThe spaces between the myelin sheaths are known as the nodes of Ranvier. These areas are brimming with voltage-gated ion channels to help push the signal along. Since these areas are unsheathed, it is also where the positive ions gather, to help balance out the negative ions. When the channels open, there are plenty of positive ions waiting to swarm inside. It almost looks like the signal jumps from node to node, in a process known as **saltatory conduction**. To saltate means to move by leaps or jumps, like the action potential seems to do down the axon. In reality, the internal current of flowing positive ions is activating the opening of the gates down the axon.\\n\\n[[\u2603 image 4]]\\n\\n## Consider the Following:\\n\\n* Pain is actually one of the slowest sensations our bodies can send. Smaller fibers without myelin, like the ones carrying pain information, carry signals at about 0.5-2.0 m/s (1.1-4.5 miles per hour). The fastest signals in our bodies are sent by larger, myelinated axons found in neurons that transmit the sense of touch or proprioception \u2013 80-120 m/s (179-268 miles per hour). Scientists believe that this reflects the evolution of these senses - pain was among the most important things to sense, and so was the first to develop through small, simple nerves. More nuanced senses like vibration and light touch evolved later, in larger, more complex structures.\\n\\n* Demyelination diseases that degrade the myelin coating on cells include Guillain-Barre syndrome and Multiple Sclerosis. Guillain-Barre syndrome is the destruction of Schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system), while MS is caused by a loss of oligodendrocytes (in the brain and spinal column). These disorders have different causes and presentations, but both involve muscle weakness and numbness or tingling. These symptoms occur because the nerves aren\u2019t sending information the right way. When the myelin coating of nerves degenerates, the signals are either diminished or completely destroyed. If the nerves are afferent (sensory) fibers, the destruction of myelin leads to numbness or tingling, because sensations aren\u2019t traveling the way they should. When efferent (motor) nerves are demyelinated, this can lead to weakness because the brain is expending a lot of energy but is still unable to actually move the affected limbs. Limbs are especially affected, because they have the longest nerves, and the longer the nerve, the more myelin it has that can potentially be destroyed.\\n\\n[[\u2603 explanation 1]]\\n\",\"images\":{},\"widgets\":{\"image 1\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[598,203],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8cbccf1a1c592ea7fb8faa049053a3d97b026d8f.svg\",\"width\":598,\"height\":203},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Diagram of neuron with dendrites, cell body, axon and action potential\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 2\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[383,314],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ca9ca21206c0fd7ff954855bb9dc36326b895770.svg\",\"width\":383,\"height\":314},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Diagram of large-diameter axon vs small diameter axon\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 3\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[652,462],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f0bfc223b7198a34419d8d8bd90d9afbab5ba6b8.svg\",\"width\":652,\"height\":462},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Diagram of myelinated axon and saltatory spread; unmyelinated axon and slow spread\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"image 4\":{\"type\":\"image\",\"alignment\":\"block\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"range\":[[0,10],[0,10]],\"box\":[615,597],\"backgroundImage\":{\"url\":\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9357bd82653bb1852945c776a8c019708b3950db.svg\",\"width\":615,\"height\":597},\"labels\":[],\"alt\":\"Diagram of saltatory conduction\",\"caption\":\"\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}},\"explanation 1\":{\"type\":\"explanation\",\"alignment\":\"default\",\"static\":false,\"graded\":true,\"options\":{\"static\":false,\"showPrompt\":\"Attribution and references\",\"hidePrompt\":\"Hide references\",\"explanation\":\"## Attribution:\\n\\nThis article is licensed under a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"},\"version\":{\"major\":0,\"minor\":0}}}}]",
